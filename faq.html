            <h2>What is TDEE?</h2>
            <p>TDEE, or Total Daily Energy Expenditure, is the total number of calories your body burns in a day, including all activities and bodily functions. It helps you understand how much energy you need to maintain, lose, or gain weight. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="list-group-item">
            <h2>How is TDEE calculated?</h2>
            <p> TDEE estimations are calculated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation.
                This equation calculates your Basic Metabolic Rate (BMR) using your physical stats (weight, height and age). <br> 
                Then, it is multiplied by your activity level in order to obtain TDEE estimations.

        <div class="list-group-item">
            <h2>Why is it important to know my TDEE?</h2>
            <p>Knowing your TDEE is important because it tells you how many calories your body needs to maintain its current weight. This helps you plan your diet and exercise to effectively lose, gain, or maintain weight. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="list-group-item">
            <h2>How do I adjust my diet?</h2>
            <p>To adjust your diet, aim to eat about 500 calories more than your TDEE to gain weight, or 500 calories less to lose weight. This creates a manageable surplus or deficit while allowing you to maintain a balanced intake of proteins, carbs, and fats.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="list-group-item">
            <h2>Is your calculator accurate?</h2>
            <p>Our calculator provides a solid estimate based on widely used formulas like Mifflin-St Jeor, but individual needs can vary. Factors like metabolism, activity level, and body composition mean your exact TDEE might differ, so use it as a guideline and adjust based on results. </p>
