<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Wilber and welcome to my website.<br>
For close to a decade, I have been an avid Weight lifter. I have set many personal records including a 500lb deadlift, 405lb squat and a 325lb bench press.
Weightlifting is my favorite hobby outside of programming. I have worked with various programming languages including Python, Java and C++.</p>

<h2>Website</h2>
<p> I created this website with a goal in mind. To create a tool that people can use in order to reach their body weight goals. <br>
    Whether it's to lose or gain weight, using tools like my TDEE calculator sets people on the right path to their goals. <br>
    In addition to helping others, I wanted to expand my programming skills. In order to make my website come to life, I knew I had to strenghten my Javascript and HTML/CSS skills.
</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>Just like weight lifting, coding is about challenging yourself and striving for improvement. Building this TDEE calculator combines both passions—using code to measure, understand, and optimize your body’s energy needs, turning data into actionable progress.</p>
