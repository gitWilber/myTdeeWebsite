<h2>Me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Wilber and welcome to my website.<br>
For close to a decade, I have been an avid Weight lifter. I have set many personal records including a 500lb deadlift, 405lb squat and a 325lb bench press.
Weightlifting is my favorite hobby outside of programming. I have worked with various programming languages including Python, C++, Java, etc</p>

</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>Just like weight lifting, code is like challenging yourself to</p>
